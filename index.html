<h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of Web and HTML</h2>
<h2><b>Important Information:</b></h2>
<br>
<div class="topdiv">
<b>The World Wide Web:</b>
<p>The world wide web is made up of HTML files. These files are what makes the World Wide Web, "web-like." The Major pieces of the internet are, you(your computer), the internet and servers. HTTP is used to communicate between your computer and the web server.
</p>
</div>
<div>
  <b>HTML is made up of:</b>
<p>
  Text Content(what you see)
  Markup(what it looks like)
  References to other Documents(for example: images or videos)
  Links to other Pages
</p>
</div>
<div>
<br>
  <b>Tags:</b>
<p>
  HTML also uses tags. Tags are used so the computer can understand what you want it to do, or so you can tell the computer what you want something to look like.
  <br>In between those tags is the content.
  <br>The Tag and the Content together, make your element.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bottomdiv">
<br>
  <b>Imprtant things to remember:</b>
<p>
  When writing code, you need to be very precise with your imputs, because if your aren't, the computer will not understand what you are trying to tell it. In a sense, computers are "stupid."
  <br>You can't remember everything, so don't feel bad about having to look things up on Google(or whatever search engine is your preference).
  <br>There are also two different kinds of elements, block and inline.
    <br>Block organizes text into blocks and inline, well.....doesn't.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document With HTML</h2>
<br>
<div class="topdiv">
<br>
<b>Tree-like Structure</b>
<p>HTML uses a "tree-like" structure in a sense because you can have elements inside of elements and so on. This stucture shows up as a series of nested boxes. This structure makes it easier to read the code for the document.</p>
</div>
<div>
<b>Indented Boxes</b>
<p>When you read an HTML document as text you will see waves of indentations going up and down the document. When the content is more and more indented, it shows that it is more deeply nested into it's box.</p>
</div>
<div class="bottomdiv">
<b>Text Editors</b>
<p>Programmers use a text editor to write their code. Without these programs, writing code would be much more difficult, or even impossible. An example of this would be Sublime Text. </p>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
<br>
<div class="topdiv">
<b>What is CSS?</b>
  <p>CSS is code that is written to control the "style" of HTML elements.
  <br>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets."
  </p>
</div>
<div>
<b>How do divs work?</b>  
  <p>Div elemements are <b>block</b> elements used for containing blocks of content, which could be images or paragraphs of text for example.
  <br>They can also be given a unique id tag that can be linked to a CSS syle sheet. </p>
</div>
<div>
<b>Wait.....what does "Cascading" mean?</b>  
  <p>If you remember what we talked about with the "tree-like" structure of HTML, CSS uses that inheritance sturcture.
  <br> So in a sense, it <em>cascades</em>, passing on and on the same CSS style unless told otherwise.
 </p>
</div>
<div>  
<b>The Box Model</b>
  <p>HTML Boxes have 4 elements:
    <br>
     Margin: The Margin clears an are outside the border and is transparent.
    <br>
     Border: The border goes around the padding and the content.
    <br>
     Padding: The Padding clears an area around the content and is also transparent.
    <br>
     Content: The content is where the text and images appear. This is the stuff you can actually see.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="bottomdiv">
   <b>Avoid Repitition:</b>
    <p>Unnecesary repitition is only going to seem tedious, and is really unnecesary. When coding try to avoid writing the same things over and over again unless you have to for a specific reason. </p>
